For development work, it is easiest to simply do

make

and let the Makefile build the shared object and related files. 

You MUST generate makefile_header for the Globus installation you are 
using for development by doing

globus-makefile-header --flavor=FLAVOR > makefile_header

where FLAVOR is the target flavor you are building, for
example

globus-makefile-header --flavor=gcc64dbgpthr > makefile_header

For making an installation, do the following:

1) Run 'make clean' and 'make' to build fresh.

2) Run 'python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar' to create the tarball
distribution in the dist directory.

3) The tarball can be installed directly by doing 
'python setup.py install' inside of it.

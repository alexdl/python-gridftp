Prior to compiling, first generate "makefile_header" for the Globus
installation you are using for development by doing

globus-makefile-header --flavor=FLAVOR > makefile_header

where FLAVOR is the target flavor you are building. For
example

globus-makefile-header --flavor=gcc64dbgpthr > makefile_header

For making an installation, do the following:

1) Run 'make clean' and 'make' to build fresh.

2) Run 'python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar' to create the tarball
distribution in the dist directory.

3) The tarball can be installed directly by doing 
'python setup.py install' inside of it.
